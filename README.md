This is a double pendulum simulation. I solved it using two methods: Euler's method and the Runge-Kutta-fourth-order method. 

 - Set "isEuler" on line 47 to either true or false to change the method of estimation.
 - RK4 method may not be mathematically sound (the simulation seems too fast)
 
To graph the paths of the pendulum balls uncomment lines 137 and 138 and then run the python file. In the python file set "name" equal to the name of file you want to graph the data for.
